Th10 18 18:18:47 <trananhkma>	Hi fork, I am going to test rolling upgrade for keystone.
Th10 18 18:19:25 <trananhkma>	In last 2 weeks, after upgrade keystone from mitaka to neuton, I just tested Keystone with some commands, but I think that it's not ennough (not cover all cases) to ensure OpenStack worked well after upgraded.
Th10 18 18:19:45 <stevemar>	trananhkma: cool, let us know if we can help
Th10 18 18:20:22 <trananhkma>	So, I tried to find a tool to help me cover all cases, I found Grenade.
Th10 18 18:20:45 <trananhkma>	But, When I looking to the source code of Grenade, I saw that it just be scripts to do Rolling-upgrade and create some resources.
Th10 18 18:21:06 <trananhkma>	Is it ennough to ensure OpenStack worked well?
Th10 18 18:21:29 <trananhkma>	BTW, do you have any suggestion for me to test Rolling-upgrade? Somethings like functionals test or unit test, which I can cover all the cases.

Th10 18 18:22:23 <trananhkma>	stevemar, hello :) could you give me any suggestion?
Th10 18 18:22:42 <stevemar>	trananhkma: when testing he upgrade, how did you do it?
Th10 18 18:23:14 <stevemar>	trananhkma: did you follow the steps here: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/upgrading.html#upgrading-without-downtime ?
Th10 18 18:23:27 <stevemar>	specifically... keystone-manage db_sync --expand ; keystone-manage db_sync --migrate; keystone-manage db_sync --contract ?
Th10 18 18:23:58 <trananhkma>	stevemar, yes, I did
Th10 18 18:24:34 <trananhkma>	stevemar, but I want to makesure OpenStack worked well
Th10 18 18:24:38 <stevemar>	trananhkma: did you have any credentials created? the ones created with /v3/credentials?
Th10 18 18:24:54 <trananhkma>	yes I tried
Th10 18 18:25:32 <stevemar>	i think a good test would be creating credentials while the ``keystone-manage db_sync --migrate`` step is running
Th10 18 18:26:03 <stevemar>	the only tricky part about the rolling upgrade for M->N is that we encrypted existing credentials
Th10 18 18:26:41 <stevemar>	so it would be good to see what happens if new credentials are created while we're going through the encryption process
Th10 18 18:27:00 <stevemar>	the encryption process occurs when you do the --migrate command
Th10 18 18:29:46 <trananhkma>	stevemar, yes, I see, but do we have any test tool - like unit test, which we can cover all cases? include other projects
Th10 18 18:30:09 <stevemar>	trananhkma: not that i know of :(
Th10 18 18:34:02 <jamielennox>	jlk, morgan: because i'm a sucker: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/387752/
Th10 18 18:34:03 <trananhkma>	stevemar, I already tried like your suggestion, but I afraid that we can missed something, so I want to find an official tool which can do that. thank you :)
Th10 18 18:34:26 <stevemar>	jamielennox: hehe
Th10 18 18:34:36 <stevemar>	jamielennox: i think you mean "because I'm awesome"
Th10 18 18:34:46 <jamielennox>	stevemar: depends on your point of view i gues
Th10 18 18:35:28 <jamielennox>	stevemar: awesome could be getting some sucker to deal with problems
Th10 18 18:36:05 <jamielennox>	stevemar: you've already +2ed it, but https://review.openstack.org/#/c/387733/ sunk my user_agent plans
