Th10 19 02:02:08 <masterjcool>	My vms lose their ipv4 address every once in a while. It looks like neutron-dhcp-agent just isn't responding to the client.
Th10 19 02:02:54 <masterjcool>	If I inspect /var/lib/neutron/dhcp/<net-id>/host file, the entry for the vm is missing. Killing the corresponding dnsmasq process and restarting neutron-dhcp-agent helps.
Th10 19 02:03:12 <masterjcool>	Any idea why some vms lose their ipv4?
Th10 19 02:08:55 <sobczyk>	is openstack a good choice for private cloud consisting of 3-5 PCs, or should I try something else?
