Th10 19 01:11:39 <Carry_M>	Hi
Th10 19 01:12:36 <Carry_M>	I installed neutron-mettering-agent on my neutron server. it works with nod error. But the data of meter labels dosn't captured by ceilometer.

Th10 19 01:38:51 <masterjcool>	My VMs lose ipv4 address every once in a while. Stopping neutron-dhcp-agent, killing the dnsmasq process for the corresponding project, and then starting neutron-dhcp-agent helps.
Th10 19 01:39:04 <masterjcool>	What could be going on?
Th10 19 01:41:01 <masterjcool>	It looks like the dhcp agent just isn't responding to the client. If I inspect the /var/lib/neutron/dhcp/<netid>/host file, the vm without ipv4 addr is missing frmo the list.
