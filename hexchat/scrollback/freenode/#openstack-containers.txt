T 1478542477 18<adrian_otto18>	ok, so your intended design is to have a synchronous link between magnum and the driver?

T 1478542544 18<randallburt18>	adrian_otto:  no, I just want to keep the existing interface so that magnum can do the polling but leverage the existing magnum code to call it

T 1478542599 18<adrian_otto18>	so I'm working to understand the difference between calling get_poller() and then monitoring for a state change vs. calling a driver function to get the current state. They seem equivalent to me.

T 1478542732 18<adrian_otto18>	maybe you could help me understand how using the get_poller interface keeps the driver from needing to do async updates?

T 1478542837 18<adrian_otto18>	because the polling would be in Magnum rather than in the driver.

T 1478542917 18<adrian_otto18>	ok, but Hongbin's POV anticipates that future drivers may use more advanced eventing around state changes, that could be implemented in the driver, and keep Magnum simple.
