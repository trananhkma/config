T 1478542763 18<mriedem18>	the only downside might be baking attaching state logic into the create_attachment call...but i thought the attachments had some status value or something
T 1478542802 18<mriedem18>	like maybe the attachment record is ATTACHING until it's updated with a connector, at which point it's ATTACHED, and the volume doesn't go in-use until all of it's attachments are ATTACHED
T 1478542838 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: correct, we have an attach_status in the attachment object
T 1478542845 18<mriedem18>	that is racy though b/c nova updates the attachment with the connector before it calls os-brick to connect the volume....but nova also rolls that back if the os-brick connect_volume call fails
T 1478542851 18<mriedem18>	at that point nova might just delete the attachment
T 1478542860 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: the only thing I need to figure out is the relationship between the volume-status and the attachment_status
T 1478542876 18<jgriffith18>	what we have currently has some problems with them getting out of sync
T 1478542912 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: so if Nova does that we should just have it call attachment_update to reflect that no?
T 1478542937 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: the multi-attach case of the volume-status is something that needs some work

T 1478542962 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: so the problem today is we use both
T 1478542967 18<mriedem18>	when does nova get the connection_info back? when it provides the connector when calling update-attachment?
T 1478543002 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: we use volume-status [attaching, in-use, detaching, available], and we also use attachment_status [attaching, detaching, attached, detached]

T 1478543743 18<mriedem18>	but new nova-api would call create_attachment and store the attachment_id in the bdm i think
T 1478543752 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: right, I just have to be careful of how things transition, in other words, the "old" method not using/cleaning up all of the things in the attachment object
T 1478543761 18<mriedem18>	computes can check the bdm.attachment_id to know if the api did the new thing or not

T 1478543786 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: so the nova change I pushed of this does exactly that (stores the attahment_id in the bdm) and uses that to determine what to call
T 1478543835 18<jgriffith18>	mriedem: I'm just considering the case of starting things on an updated compute-node and finishing them (detaching etc) on an "old" version of the compute node.  That's a bug in the V1 POC that I never fixed

T 1478562963 18<hemna18>	modify the drivers to return a shared flag.....
T 1478562975 18<jgriffith18>	hemna: yeah, that we HAVE to do regardless
T 1478562991 18<hemna18>	or have the volume manager look at the target information and compare it to existing attachments to the same host
T 1478563001 18<hemna18>	the target should be identical for the shared exports no ?
T 1478563009 18<jgriffith18>	hemna: oh, yeah... I guess that's actually not so bad
T 1478563023 18<jgriffith18>	hemna: in fact I did that at one point :(  "get_attachments_by_host"

T 1484613083 18<patrickeast18>	i recall various points in time we talked about using an automated list of drivers for things... but afaik most public ones are manually maintained
T 1484613092 18<smcginnis18>	patrickeast: To get the list of all drivers. Most visibly it's used for the published driver list, but I still am hoping to expand that to do additional checks and things.
T 1484613114 18<smcginnis18>	patrickeast: There's also a patch somewhere to replace our driver capability wiki table with an automatically generated table.
