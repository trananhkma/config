T 1484600524 18<jroll18>	rloo: hm, I wonder if we should really wait for the deadline to branch
T 1484600529 18<jroll18>	* I will branch the requirements repository shortly after all of the cycle-with-milestone projects have branched. After the requirements repository is branched and the master requirements list is opened, projects that have not branched will be tested with Pike requirements as the requirements master branch advances and stable/ocata stays stable. Waiting too long to create the stable/ocata branch may
T 1484600531 18<jroll18>	result in broken CI jobs in either stable/ocata or master. Don't delay any further than necessary.
T 1484600551 18<jroll18>	it might be fine but we might end up with broken stable/ocata CI for a bit
T 1484600565 18<rloo18>	jroll: sigh.
T 1484600588 18<jroll18>	I suspect that will be tagged jan 30ish
T 1484600603 18<rloo18>	jroll: i don't think we want broken CI jobs
T 1484600611 18<jroll18>	well, it's a *might*
T 1484600631 18<jroll18>	e.g. if a dependency is released, and our tests work with the new but not the old
T 1484600633 18<jroll18>	or something
T 1484600646 18<rloo18>	jroll: well, much as i'd like to get 'everything' or 'as much as possible', maybe we should be pessimistic and set an earlier target date for ocata.
T 1484600651 18<jroll18>	seems like it would be hard to get hit
T 1484600664 18<jroll18>	rloo: yeah, let's see how we look on rc1 week
T 1484600691 18<rloo18>	jroll: i think we should mention to folks that there is a high probability that we cut a branch on rc1. otherwise, you know, procrastination...
T 1484600745 18<rloo18>	jroll: i'm worried now that rolling upgrades may not make it. or driver composition. will have a better idea at end of week i guess.
T 1484600775 18<jroll18>	rloo: we shall see
T 1484600788 18<jroll18>	I'll talk to dmitry about release date too, see what he thinks

T 1484601037 18<TheJulia18>	Good scotch, tequila, or whisky?

T 1484601224 18<jroll18>	rloo: I suspect it's more like, if nobody runs, someone will step up at the last minute that shouldn't be
