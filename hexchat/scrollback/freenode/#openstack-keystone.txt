T 1476789527 20<trananhkma>30	Hi fork, I am going to test rolling upgrade for keystone.
T 1476789565 20<trananhkma>30	In last 2 weeks, after upgrade keystone from mitaka to neuton, I just tested Keystone with some commands, but I think that it's not ennough (not cover all cases) to ensure OpenStack worked well after upgraded.
T 1476789585 19<stevemar>	trananhkma: cool, let us know if we can help
T 1476789622 20<trananhkma>30	So, I tried to find a tool to help me cover all cases, I found Grenade.
T 1476789645 20<trananhkma>30	But, When I looking to the source code of Grenade, I saw that it just be scripts to do Rolling-upgrade and create some resources.
T 1476789666 20<trananhkma>30	Is it ennough to ensure OpenStack worked well?
T 1476789689 20<trananhkma>30	BTW, do you have any suggestion for me to test Rolling-upgrade? Somethings like functionals test or unit test, which I can cover all the cases.

T 1476789743 20<trananhkma>30	stevemar, hello :) could you give me any suggestion?
T 1476789762 19<stevemar>	trananhkma: when testing he upgrade, how did you do it?
T 1476789794 19<stevemar>	trananhkma: did you follow the steps here: http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/upgrading.html#upgrading-without-downtime ?
T 1476789807 18<stevemar18>	specifically... keystone-manage db_sync --expand ; keystone-manage db_sync --migrate; keystone-manage db_sync --contract ?
T 1476789838 20<trananhkma>30	stevemar, yes, I did
T 1476789874 20<trananhkma>30	stevemar, but I want to makesure OpenStack worked well
T 1476789878 19<stevemar>	trananhkma: did you have any credentials created? the ones created with /v3/credentials?
T 1476789894 20<trananhkma>30	yes I tried
T 1476789932 18<stevemar18>	i think a good test would be creating credentials while the ``keystone-manage db_sync --migrate`` step is running
T 1476789963 18<stevemar18>	the only tricky part about the rolling upgrade for M->N is that we encrypted existing credentials
T 1476790001 18<stevemar18>	so it would be good to see what happens if new credentials are created while we're going through the encryption process
T 1476790020 18<stevemar18>	the encryption process occurs when you do the --migrate command
T 1476790186 20<trananhkma>30	stevemar, yes, I see, but do we have any test tool - like unit test, which we can cover all cases? include other projects

T 1478557647 18<vdavidoff18>	Hello. I am using Keysone with LDAP for k8s authentication. It works. Is there a way to configure Keystone to also return a user's group memberships, as queried from LDAP? I believe I have configured all the right LDAP group settings in keystone.conf, but I don't think any attempt is being made to find a user's groups.

T 1481809456 18<ayoung18>	breton_, you want to discuss this now?  I am game.
T 1481809498 18<ayoung18>	With fernet, we defer a lot to python-cryptography
T 1481809509 18<breton_18>	ayoung: i have 15 minutes, so lets try
T 1481809510 18<ayoung18>	we don't want to be in the business of defining things like keystore etc
T 1481809529 18<ayoung18>	these are security sensitive areas, cross cutting concernts etc
T 1481809558 18<ayoung18>	so We could have implemented even Fernet strictly in Keystone, but chose to work with the python-cryptography team instead
T 1481809565 18<ayoung18>	its mostly the Barbican folks
T 1481809577 18<ayoung18>	for a Keystore, it is the same kind of issue:
T 1481809591 18<ayoung18>	ideally, it would be stored in some form of Hardened container
T 1481809631 18<ayoung18>	but we don;t want to be defining that in Keystone, anymore than we would be writing a database
T 1481809680 18<ayoung18>	so, lets assume that there is a keystore abstraction in python-cryptography, and we just need to have the configuration options in Keystone to say how to fine it, what type it is etc
T 1481809700 18<ayoung18>	and then the rest goes into python-cryptography.
T 1481809714 18<ayoung18>	breton_, we actually are addressing this issue at the platform level in my group:
T 1481809749 18<ayoung18>	there is a system tool called custodia that we are developing for use cases like this.  And remember, we are going to be talking containers and all that , so it is a pretty tricky omne to deal with

T 1481809893 18<ayoung18>	So, we don't need the Manager abstraction inside Keystone, although the end state will look similar to an outsider, just it will use the python-cryptography abstraction, and keystone will only hold the configuration option for it.
T 1481809923 18<ayoung18>	breton_, one other place this came up is for multi-keystone Fernet key exchange
T 1481809974 18<ayoung18>	the fact that we built out own actually goes against one of the workflow constraints of Tripleo/Fuel/Kolla, which is that all the provisioning happens on the configuration nodes, and then gets pushed to all of the controllers equally
T 1481810012 18<ayoung18>	there are lots of examples of prior art for how to do key exchanges in a secure manner and all that, but again, we don't want to write that into Keystone
T 1481810024 18<ayoung18>	breton_, OK?

T 1481810134 18<ayoung18>	breton_, Good question. It has been focused on other use cases, and makes some assumptions that may not hold true for us.
T 1481810167 18<ayoung18>	There is also the whole "it was developed by Red Hat" aspect that means it is less tested on Debian based platforms
T 1481810178 18<breton_18>	ayoung: i pursue only 1 use case in the patches: rotation for keystone in docker containers

T 1481810207 18<ayoung18>	breton_, I hope at least 2, as we need exactly that for Credentials as well

T 1481810240 18<breton_18>	ayoung: well, actually no. dolphm had an idea to store fernet keys in the credentials database

T 1481810350 18<breton_18>	but the keys for credentials are rotated not so often
T 1481810363 18<ayoung18>	breton_, so, before I lift any -2, do your due dilligence.  Go talk with the python cryptography folks.  Look into Custodia, and also how docker/Kubernetes does secrets
T 1481810384 18<ayoung18>	Ansible, too
T 1481810412 18<ayoung18>	If it turns out that this is absolutly the only way, I will back off
T 1481810457 18<ayoung18>	However, I suspect that the right approach is actually using some form of Key exchange protocol and a hardened datastore for the keys
T 1481810500 18<ayoung18>	when you call the fernet function in python-cryptography, you should be passing in  keystore.
T 1481810510 18<breton_18>	i don't need hardened datastore and i don't do the backends for security or distributing reasons

T 1481812167 18<kukacz18>	dstanek: in the backend, it takes the username and password from some environment variables and passess them with the request to keystone
