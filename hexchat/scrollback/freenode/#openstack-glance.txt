In Newton it is deprecated for removal and the release notes point at setting things in policy.json to control this behavior.  Using policy.json alone to control this behavior doesn't work in Newton and it appears to not work yet in Ocata.  Is removal of this property and migration to use only policy to control this still planned for Ocata?
T 1483555080 18<stevelle18>	smatzek: I would not expect actual removal to happen in Ocata

T 1483555194 18<smatzek18>	show_multiple_locations must be set to allow Nova snapshot of a Ceph backed instance to a Ceph backed Glance.  I need this functionality.

T 1483555236 18<smatzek18>	so my question is, to get this functionality in Newton, and currently in Ocata I must continue to set this deprecated setting, per https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/api/v2/images.py#L294
T 1483555274 18<smatzek18>	and where I'm looking for clarity is if the code above will change in Ocata to make it so that conf setting goes away and it's 100% controlled by policy.
T 1483555318 18<flwang118>	smatzek: hmm... that code is only using for locations update

T 1483555405 18<smatzek18>	when Nova ephemeral disk and Glance backing store are both Ceph backed Nova creates a queued image, does efficient snapshot direct in Ceph and updates the image location via PATCH API to point at the new RBD object.
T 1483555481 18<smatzek18>	what's really driving this question is my proposed change to OpenStack-Ansible to set show_multiple_locations=True when Ceph is in use in this review  https://review.openstack.org/#/c/413174/1

T 1483555532 18<smatzek18>	the question is, if that property isn't going to be necessary in Ocata for the Nova Snapshot flow to work, should we be setting it in OpenStack-Ansible master/Ocata.  So I'm wondering if the current Ocata behavior will change to be 100% controlled via policy.

T 1483565489 18<smatzek18>	yep
T 1483565511 18<flwang118>	smatzek: may i know how did you test the multi locations?
T 1483565570 18<flwang118>	did you just set show_multiple_locations=false and set get_image_location and delete_image_location with admin only in policy file?
T 1483565592 18<smatzek18>	set up OpenStack with Ceph backed Nova and Ceph backed Glance without the show_multiple_locations property set in glance api conf.  Launch and instance from horizon.  Snapshot instance from horizon.  Fails with 403 from Glance inside Nova compute.
T 1483565648 18<flwang118>	smatzek: ok, i see, thanks
T 1483565658 18<smatzek18>	policy.json has:      "context_is_admin":  "role:admin",
T 1483565658 18<smatzek18>	    "default": "role:admin",
T 1483565658 18<smatzek18>	 and     "delete_image_location": "",
T 1483565658 18<smatzek18>	    "get_image_location": "",
T 1483565658 18<smatzek18>	    "set_image_location": "",
T 1483565675 18<smatzek18>	so admin has policy authority to the actions
T 1483565753 18<flwang118>	yep, i understand. basically we need to replace the check at https://github.com/openstack/glance/blob/master/glance/api/v2/images.py#L294 with a policy check
T 1483565853 18<smatzek18>	though you could do this without Nova in the picture with Glance alone, create an image in the queued state and then use the PATCH api, http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref/image/v2/?expanded=update-an-image-detail, to add the location
T 1483565932 18<flwang118>	right, got it
T 1483565937 18<flwang118>	thanks for the clarification
