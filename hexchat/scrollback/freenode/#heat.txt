T 1481830512 18<stingaci18>	Hello. While trying to use SoftwareConfigs, I've managed to understand the relationship between the 'group' attribute and the heat hooks built into the image you're deploying. However I can't seem to find any documentation explaining what 'group=ungrouped' does. Does it try to determine the hook type automatically?

T 1481831386 18<stingaci18>	Also, is my understanding correct? If you associate a SoftwareConfig resource directly to the 'user_data' attribute of a resource directly, the instance will use cloud-init to apply the configuration, but if you use a SoftwareDeployment to associate a SoftwareConfig to a resource then the instance will use heat-config to apply the configuration (in which case the 'group' attribute is irrelevant).

T 1483537780 18<robcresswell18>	I think that equality test is throwing the warnings. Previously we were just squashing them. I'm not sure that Heat should really be throwing that error for an equality check :/

T 1484570409 18<therve18>	I think it doesn't answer our main concern, which is being able to trigger a workflow based on stack/resource operations

T 1484571068 18<gfidente18>	therve so you're suggesting that
T 1484571093 18<gfidente18>	we should rather have a list of actions for the existing workflow resource and trigger execution when action is matched?
T 1484571125 18<therve18>	gfidente, No I think it deserves a new resource. But that resource needs some kind of actions

T 1484571300 18<gfidente18>	if in the template an execution resource refers to a workflow via get_resource, the execution will be deleted/recreated if the parent workflow is updated
T 1484571304 18<gfidente18>	is the above correct?
T 1484571487 18<therve18>	That depends on your resource implementation

T 1484571823 18<therve18>	But I don't think that's the main issue we have
T 1484571853 18<therve18>	What we want is being to control whether the workflow executes on stack update
