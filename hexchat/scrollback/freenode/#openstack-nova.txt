T 1478546891 18<ildikov18>	cburgess: reserve is smart enough to handle multi-attach, just like the new calls will be that we're planning
T 1478546900 18<cburgess18>	mriedem ildikov nic and I already worked out how to do this on the cinder and nova side using reserve. We just need to write a cinder spec for the changes and work on getting it landed.
T 1478546906 18<mriedem18>	ildikov: but not for a volume that is still being created
T 1478546912 18<mriedem18>	which is what chet cares about
T 1478546915 18<ildikov18>	cburgess: besides that we only considered the current behavior
T 1478546955 18<cburgess18>	ildikov The problem with reserve as written today is that it is monotomic. So with multiattach it supports a multiattach volume but *not* if its already been reserved. So you can only issue reserve once on a volume and then you have to wait until its no longer "attaching".
T 1478546987 18<cburgess18>	ildikov At least thats what I seem to recall from reading the code a few weeks ago, maybe I'm wrong.
T 1478546991 18<dansmith18>	bauzas: to resume, you think that even with one call, we should pass a tuple of (reqspec, instance) to the build call, right?
T 1478547014 18<mriedem18>	cburgess: that's correct
T 1478547029 18<cburgess18>	mriedem ildikov So the TL;DR version is.. I don't have an objection to the patch set to remove check-attach and use reserve. Just makes my life harder, but its OpenStack, I'm used to that.

T 1481808905 18<johnthetubaguy18>	there is policy rule that says we check for role=admin, to allow you to see beyond the regular scope of your token

T 1484564254 18<lyarwood18>	mdbooth: I think mounted was False previously in this test so os.stat was nnenver called
T 1484564286 18<mdbooth18>	lyarwood: Right. I suspect it was false because it wasn't mocked, and therefore was never going to work in a test environment

T 1484564490 18<lyarwood18>	validate_volume is calling command = ['getfattr', "-n", "quobyte.info", mnt_base]    so I guess it's just mocking a failure of that
T 1484564507 18<lyarwood18>	so it doesn't really matter what we do in connect_volume as long as the volume is mounted in the end
